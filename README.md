# SpaceHelmet
Adds a special item called `Space Helmet` on your server.\
Original item by [Hypixel](https://hypixel.net).

## Usage
Type `/spacehelm`<sup>only works if you're op</sup> on your server with this plugin installed.
\
You can type the command shown below instead if you want to give the item to another player.
    
    /spacehelm <player_name_here>

## Limits
Client handles the creative mode inventory unlike the survival mode inventory. It means you can't equip the space helmet just by clicking the helmet slot with the space helmet on your cursor.
The only solution is to equip the helmet with right click.

You may still equip the helmet like other vanilla helmets if you're in survival mode.
