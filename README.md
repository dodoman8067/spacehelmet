# SpaceHelmet
Adds `Space Helmet` item on your server.\
Original item by [Hypixel](https://hypixel.net).

## How to get item?
Simple!
Just type `/spacehelm`<sup>only works if you're an op</sup> on your server with this plugin installed!
\
If you want to give this item to other players, you can type this command instead.
    
    /spacehelm <player_name_here>

## Limits
Client handles creative mode inventory,
means you can't equip the space helmet manually clicking the helmet slot with the helmet on the cursor.
The only solution is to equip the helmet with right click.
But you can still equip the helmet on survival mode inventory like normal helmets!
